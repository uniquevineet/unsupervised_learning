Applying unsupervised learning algorithms on online shoppers intention data and model building

Unsupervised learning includes KMeans Clustering and Agglomerative Clustering. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) done to understand the dimensionality reduction process. Finally building various classification models on PCA data as well as data without PCA to understand the difference between the two.
